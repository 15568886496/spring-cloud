step1.build docker image

in each service we should create a Dockerfile, because we should base this file to build image.
The important thing is we should move the xxx.jar in resources folder.

eg:
  docker build image commandsï¼š
   docker build -f Dockerfile -t "${service_jar_name}":$version .
   docker build -f Dockerfile -t eureka-client:V1.1 .

step2. start up all the image and communicate with each services.

  We should create a file names docker-compose.yml

  and then we can compose all the services in one file.

  We can config the network to guarantee each service can access other services.

  The most important thing is we should expose the port for we can access the service out of the container.
